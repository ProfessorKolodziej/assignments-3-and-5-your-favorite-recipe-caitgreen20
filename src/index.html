	<p>These anise cookies, also called Italian Anisette Cookies, are a holiday dessert favorite, just like my <a href="https://amandascookin.com/thumbprint-cookies-easiest-recipe-ever/">Thumbprint Cookies</a> that everyone goes crazy over.</p>

	<h2> Why we love this recipe</h2>
	<section class="story">
		<div>
		<p> Whether you choose to make these cookies with anise or without, they always seem to be a crowd-pleaser. Since this recipe makes <strong>a lot of cookies</strong>, they also make the perfect treats to bring along to a holiday gathering or family get-together.</p>
		<p>I’m British, so naturally, I love the licorice flavor in Italian anisette cookies. You can certainly replace the anise extract in this recipe with lemon or vanilla extract if you have people who love the texture of these cookies, but not the licorice flavor. They will taste delicious either way, I promise!</p>

	<h2>Ingredients you need</h2>

					<p>Next time I will be more careful with the flour, I think I added a bit too much. The tops of my cookies cracked. I also used my cookie scoop and filled it half way, which seemed to work pretty well.</p>
