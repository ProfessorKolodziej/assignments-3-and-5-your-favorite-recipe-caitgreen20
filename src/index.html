	<p>These anise cookies, also called Italian Anisette Cookies, are a holiday dessert favorite, just like my <a href="https://amandascookin.com/thumbprint-cookies-easiest-recipe-ever/">Thumbprint Cookies</a> that everyone goes crazy over.</p>
	<h2> Why we love this recipe</h2>
		<p> Whether you choose to make these cookies with anise or without, they always seem to be a crowd-pleaser. Since this recipe makes <strong>a lot of cookies</strong>, they also make the perfect treats to bring along to a holiday gathering or family get-together.</p>
		<p>I’m British, so naturally, I love the licorice flavor in Italian anisette cookies. You can certainly replace the anise extract in this recipe with lemon or vanilla extract if you have people who love the texture of these cookies, but not the licorice flavor. They will taste delicious either way, I promise!</p>

	<h2>Ingredients you need</h2>
		<p>This recipe is a little different than most cookies in that you will melt the butter. I promise it works!</p>

	<h2>How to make Italian anisette cookies</h2>
		<p>These step by step photos and instructions are here to help you visualize how to make this recipe.</p>
	<h3>For cookies:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter and shortening together. Add the sugar; mix well.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S01.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in the anise extract.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S02.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Sift or whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.</li>
			<li>Add to creamed mixture gradually. If the dough is too sticky to roll in the palm of your hand, add flour until firmer, but it should be very soft.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S03.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Roll dough into small balls, about 1/2 tablespoon each, and place on ungreased cookie sheets.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S04.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Bake @ 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes (the bottom should be lightly browned but the tops should remain light). Remove cookies to wire rack and cool completely before glazing.</li>

		</ol>
	<h3>For the glaze:</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Mix milk GRADUALLY into confectioners’ sugar to make a thick glaze… make sure to keep it on the thick side.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S06.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Dip top of each cookie into the glaze.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S07.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>Sprinkle with colored nonpareils while glaze is still wet.</li>
			<p><img src="images/Italian-Anisette-Cookies-Anise-S08.jpg" alt="image"></p>
			<li>I usually dip 10-12 cookies, return them to the wire rack (with wax paper under the racks to aid in clean up!) and then sprinkle those cookies before starting to dip more.</li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Tips:</h2>
		<p><strong>Dip and sprinkle 5 cookies at a time</strong>,  that seemed to be the magic number before the glaze would start to harden.</p>
		<p>This Italian anisette cookies recipe makes a lot of cookies, depending on how large you roll them. <strong>As instructed you should get about 6 dozen.</strong></p>

				<li>4 large eggs</li>
				<li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>

		<h3>Before you begin:</h3>
			<ul>

					<li>Mix in the anise extract. Sift or whisk together flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
					<li>Add to creamed mixture gradually. If the dough is too sticky to roll in the palm of your hand, add flour until firmer, but it should be very soft.</li>

					<li>Bake @ 375 degrees for 8-10 minutes (the bottom should be lightly browned but the tops should remain light).</li>
					<li>Remove cookies to wire rack and cool completely before glazing.</li>

				<h4>Amanda's Notes:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Next time I will be more careful with the flour, I think I added a bit too much. The tops of my cookies cracked. I also used my cookie scoop and filled it half way, which seemed to work pretty well.</li>
					</ul>
